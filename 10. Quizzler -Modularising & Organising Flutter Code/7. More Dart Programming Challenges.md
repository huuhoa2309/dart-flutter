<p><strong>If you are already familiar with OOP</strong> and want to quickly get up to speed with the Dart programming language. I recommend heading over to the <a href="https://exercism.io/my/tracks/dart" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Dart Track on Exercism</a> and completing the track as well as extra exercises. </p><p>or </p><p><strong>If you are completely new to programming</strong> and want to test yourself as you progress through the course, I recommend starting with the first 3 exercises in the <a href="https://exercism.io/my/tracks/dart" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Dart Track on Exercism</a> and progressing as your capability grows. This might mean coming back to Exercism when you learn more Dart concepts through the course. </p><p><br></p><figure><img src="https://udemy-images.s3.amazonaws.com:443/redactor/raw/2019-04-23_11-02-05-4a892b0d3dda3e0bc3bd69f76d0044cd.png"></figure>
