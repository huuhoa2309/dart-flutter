<p>In this challenge, we'll be providing solutions for every step. This is so that if you really get stuck on one step you can check the solution and still continue with the rest of the challenges. </p><p>It's important that you try your hardest to complete the challenges, use the Flutter/Dart docs, Google and StackOverflow to really try and complete the steps by yourself. The tutorials are helpful for students to learn a topic, but it's completing the challenges that takes you closer to <strong>mastery</strong>!</p><p>The solutions are provided via Github commits. </p><p>A new line added looks like this:</p><figure><img src="https://udemy-images.s3.amazonaws.com:443/redactor/raw/2019-03-18_15-58-06-bbced0a490395dd60e17fdbe81df3ba3.png"></figure><p>A line removed looks like this:</p><figure><img src="https://udemy-images.s3.amazonaws.com:443/redactor/raw/2019-03-18_15-57-44-a53281576e4c789528398dfeda2c242d.png"></figure><p>REMEMBER, the solution is always on the <strong>right hand pane</strong>, the left hand pane is what the code looked like on the last step, in the right hand pane are the changes that completed the current step (the solution).</p><figure><img src="https://udemy-images.s3.amazonaws.com:443/redactor/raw/2019-03-18_16-00-13-95f769d5866c21bfe43cf23ac25251b3.png"></figure><p>If you're confused how GitHub comments work, you can also just look at the files by clicking on browse files when you navigate to the solution. </p><figure><img src="https://udemy-images.s3.amazonaws.com:443/redactor/raw/2019-03-18_16-03-23-f3a6a135d63bdc1c939c04bb3996eb23.png"></figure>
