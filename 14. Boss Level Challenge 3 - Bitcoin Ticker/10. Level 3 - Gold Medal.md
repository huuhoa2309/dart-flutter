<p>If you've managed to complete the level 2 - silver challenge without looking at the solution code, then it's time to push yourself and increase the difficulty even more. Complete this final challenge to get the gold medal.</p><p><br></p><p>1. Start by<strong> cloning a fresh copy</strong> of the app that includes all the code up until this point:</p><p><a href="https://github.com/londonappbrewery/bitcoin-flutter-gold-start" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://github.com/londonappbrewery/bitcoin-flutter-gold-start</a></p><p><br></p><p>At the moment our app can only fetch the <strong>bitcoin price</strong> depending on the selected currency.</p><p>But what if we wanted other cryptocurrency prices too?</p><p><br></p><p>2. If you look inside the <strong>coin_data.dart</strong> file, you'll find a <code>const</code> called <code>cryptoList</code>. This contains a List of Strings that represent 3 cryptocurrency symbols. <strong>BTC - Bitcoin, ETH - Ethereum and LTC - Litecoin</strong>.</p><figure><img src="https://udemy-images.s3.amazonaws.com:443/redactor/raw/2019-04-11_15-56-20-27af26b02fef7156139efabd8b1d4331.png"></figure><p><br></p><p>3. Using what you have learnt in previous modules, update the code in the gold starter project to be able to display <strong>all three cryptocurrency prices</strong> in any selected currency.</p><p>Goal: By the end of this challenge, this is the functionality you should end up with:</p><figure><img src="https://udemy-images.s3.amazonaws.com:443/redactor/raw/2019-04-11_16-06-10-194d3ed780d5ecca28272ab623aec5a1.gif"></figure><p>You can check your answer against the solution by cloning this repository.
