So now that you've completed the course, the next step is to build your own ideas into Flutter apps. You've got all the skills you need to take an idea and turn it into real apps. </p><p>Start with something simple, something that you want to exist in the world. For example, a past student of ours - Ross, decided that he wanted to wake up everyday at 6AM. But it was too hard. So he built an app that will wake him up 1 minute earlier everyday and over a month he became an early riser!</p><p>Once you've got your idea sorted, the next step is to start somewhere. Break down the problem into smaller chunks. To build the weather app, we first had to figure out how to get the current location. Create a list of tiny problems that once all addressed, will turn into the final app.</p><p>Then start building! Along the way, you'll stumble upon roadblocks. Darn, I don't know how to play video or how to get the camera to work. At this point <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">StackOverflow</a>, the <a href="https://flutter.dev/docs" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Flutter docs</a> and the <a href="https://pub.dartlang.org/flutter" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Flutter Packages site</a> will be your best friends. There's also an active Flutter community on <a href="https://gitter.im/flutter/flutter" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Gitter</a>, where even the Flutter engineers occasionally browse through.</p><p>Are people not answering your questions on StackOverflow? Try and see <a href="https://medium.freecodecamp.org/5-steps-to-become-a-better-stack-overflow-user-4ce85711c0f9" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">how you can become a better S/O user</a>. Is there something you think is amiss in the flutter documentation? Try submitting an issue or even a pull request on the <a href="https://github.com/flutter/website/issues" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">flutter website's GitHub repo</a>. </p><p>Once you get comfortable building simple Flutter apps, push yourself some more. Try something more ambitious. Try teaming up with someone on the Discord channel for this course. See what it's like to collaboratively code up a project. </p><p>I look forwards to your every success!</p><p>Your instructor, Angela</p>
