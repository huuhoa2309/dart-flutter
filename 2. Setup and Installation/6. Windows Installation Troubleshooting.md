Solution: You need to enable virtualisation in your BIOS. See this: https://www.howtogeek.com/213795/how-to-enable-intel-vt-x-in-your-computers-bios-or-uefi-firmware/

If that still doesn't work, try this: https://www.thecodecity.com/2017/01/intel-haxm-is-required-to-run-this-avd.html



Problem: When you try to run an app and get an error about a SKIA shader compilation error. e.g.
