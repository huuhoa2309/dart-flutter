If the version is macOS Catalina then you should continue to the steps below. If it's lower than 10.15 e.g. 10.14 (Mojave) or 10.13 (High Sierra) then you can skip this lesson and continue to the next.

If you see /bin/zsh like in the screenshot above then congratulations, you can continue to the next lesson.

If you see /bin/bash then go through Step 3 until it reads /bin/zsh.
