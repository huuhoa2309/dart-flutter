<p>Hey guys,<br></p><p>Angela here, just wanted to let you know about something new we're bringing to all our app brewery students worldwide.</p><p>At our in-person app development courses, I tend to share a lot of the best articles I've come-across on programming, design or startup growth. The tech world moves very fast and it's difficult to keep on top of all the new developments, tools and skills.</p><p>So I'm hand-crafting an email every month-or-so, that teaches you 5 new things. You can see a sample below and decide whether if this is something you would want to read every month.</p><p>I don't want to bombard your inbox and send you something you don't want. We're also quite keen on conserving our email server quota. So take a look at this month's issue and you can sign up for the newsletter <a href="http://www.appbrewery.co/p/newsletter" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>here</strong></a> <strong>only</strong> if it is something you truly want.</p><p>Hope you're all doing well and powering through the tutorials!</p><p>Best wishes,</p><p>Your Instructor Angela</p><p><br></p><figure><a href="http://www.appbrewery.co/p/newsletter" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><img src="https://udemy-images.s3.amazonaws.com:443/redactor/raw/2019-09-17_13-48-44-8c4e21c21f55f34d704993e19c9736a2.png"></a></figure><figure><a href="http://www.appbrewery.co/p/newsletter" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><img src="https://udemy-images.s3.amazonaws.com:443/redactor/raw/2019-09-17_13-49-00-ea976e1a71a9d3aee1c95b14cd62249e.png"></a></figure><figure><a href="http://www.appbrewery.co/p/newsletter" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><img src="https://udemy-images.s3.amazonaws.com:443/redactor/raw/2019-09-17_13-49-21-92a33a10875800f042bfe16307795d08.png"></a></figure>
